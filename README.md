# Potentially hard graphs for multilevel graph partitioning solvers
Benchmark from the paper<br>
Safro, Ilya, Peter Sanders, and Christian Schulz. "Advanced coarsening schemes for graph partitioning." Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA) 19 (2015): 1-24.

Graph partitioning is a class of problems used in many fields of computer science and engineering. Applications include VLSI design, load balancing for parallel computations, machine learning to mention just a few. The multilevel graph partitioning solvers are among the most successful practical approaches. In this benchmark we include potentially hard graphs for multilevel and other graph partitioners. <br>

Highlights of technical details: 						<br>				
These graphs have been created from the real-life graphs by adding new edges (less than 3%) 		<br>				
Experimental settings (see our paper): imbalance = 3%, k=2,4,8 							<br>	
For multilevel algorithms designers: some of these graphs are here because of the big gap between the final result and that before the last refinement. <br>
